👋 Hi, I'm Josh! I'm a PhD Researcher in AI 🧠 & EO 🛰️ for Global Disaster Resilience Dynamics 🌏 in the [UKRI EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in the Application of Artificial Intelligence to the study of Environmental Risks at the University of Cambridge](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/), where I develop artificial intelligence methods to quantify exposure and risk of the built environment at large scales, enabling the beginnings of a **global risk audit**. My work measures the spatiotemporal changes in disaster risk profiles over time to assess whether countries are making progress in reducing disaster risk, ultimately to inform our collective efforts on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.
